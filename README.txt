Features: A semi-maze grid is createad for the main player "RAT" to traverse. Candies are placed around the map so the player can collect and increase
there score on contact. There is a finish line on the bottom right if the player reaches it with 10 candies or more they win otherwise they lose. There are 3 wouldbots or "GHOST". The first one is BLOEEY. BOEEY moves around the center ring if the player gets in contact you blowup and lose the game. There is ClOEEY. ClOEEY is located in the bottom left. When you come in contact with it you lose half of your candies and CLOEEY stops moving to "eat" the candies. For an odd number of candies when CLOEEY takes half you candy gets rounded up. The third bot is SCREWY. SCREWY is located in the bottom right near the finish line. SCREWY does nothing but just get in the way. SCREWY appears to be preventing you from getting in the way between you and the finish but it does nothing.
